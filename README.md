Lab 1: Set up development tools (VSCode, Node.js, Git, etc.) and created a basic Node.js script. Practiced terminal navigation, keyboard shortcuts, and generating project deliverables.
Lab 2: Practiced using Git for version control, including initializing repos, staging/committing changes, using .gitignore, exploring diffs, and cloning remote repos.
Project 1: Practiced using the terminal, created directory structures, explored system commands like ping, and wrote two Node.js scripts: one to print the current weekday and another to generate a randomized lowercase string.
Lab 3: Refactored JavaScript using modern syntax, including arrow functions, object destructuring, and the spread operator. Created and imported a Node.js module to practice modular coding.
Project 2: Practiced using git through both the CLI and VSCode Source Control while refactoring JavaScript code. Modularized functionality, eliminated global variables, and rewrote functions as expressions. Also created and used a .gitignore file and generated commit logs.
Lab 4: Built a basic web server using Node.js and Express. Learned how to initialize a project with npm, serve HTML content, configure routes with query parameters, and use git to track changes while ignoring dependencies with .gitignore.
Lab 5: Built and tested a Node.js + Express API that responds with JSON. Created GET routes to return all students or individual students by ID, and implemented a POST route to add new student data. Used Postman to verify all API functionality.
Project 3: Built the "Ultimate Coin Tool" â€” a Node.js + Express web app with two key features: calculating all US coin combinations for a given amount and computing total value of coin quantities. Implemented API routes, frontend interface, and modularized backend logic.
Lab 6: Built a digital book library using JavaScript classes. Created Book and Library classes with methods to add, list, and delete books by ISBN. Practiced using class constructors, getters, and shallow copies.
Project 4: Built a REST API using Node.js and Express to serve and manage a set of question/answer data. Created a module with functions for retrieving and manipulating the data, then connected it to a server with multiple GET routes. Tested the API using Postman. (Extra credit: added full CRUD support with POST, PUT, and DELETE.)
Lab 7: Practiced using GitHub and GitHub Pages by creating a personal site at username.github.io. Created a new GitHub repo, cloned it locally, and pushed updates. Built a small Node.js app demonstrating custom error classes, try/catch/finally, and error throwing. Committed and pushed all changes, then submitted a screenshot as proof of success.
Project 5: Built a browser-based game using a custom JavaScript class, a Node.js backend with Express, and a client interface. The game involved class-based logic (at least three properties and methods), a backend using object arrays and methods like map(), and a responsive frontend with GET and POST routes. Packaged with a custom PDF write-up and images of the working game.
Lab 8: Created an Express server that fetches photo data from an external API (JSONPlaceholder) using JavaScript promises and chaining. Built GET routes to return all or individual photo entries, and served a frontend with a dynamically generated index that displays photo titles and info via client-side fetch.
Project 6: Built a custom client-server web app using Node.js and Express. Implemented routes for all four HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), with an in-memory data array as a pseudo-database. All routes return JSON and include error handling. Created a frontend interface in the `public` folder and used GitHub to version and host the repo. Included screenshots and a summary PDF per submission requirements.
Lab 9: Completed GitHub Learning Lab course "Create a release based workflow." Practiced using GitHub release branches, pull requests, versioning, and automated workflows in a dedicated course repository. Final deliverable is a downloaded repo zip containing the completed workflow steps.
Project 7: Created a personal GitHub Pages portfolio to showcase all CIT 281 labs and projects. Each lab/project has its own repository with code and a dedicated GitHub Page describing the purpose, technologies used, and key takeaways. The main page links to each project, includes images, and serves as the central portfolio hub for the CIT minor.
